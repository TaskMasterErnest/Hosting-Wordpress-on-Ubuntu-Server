# Hosting-Wordpress-on-Ubuntu-Server
This repository contains the code and documentation for my project on learning Linux sysadmin skills, Linux security, and DevOps. I will be hosting a Wordpress website on an Ubuntu server. This project is a great way for me to learn these important skills and to get hands-on experience with Linux.
